# 🏰 **Pack The Feed – A Quest to End Waste and Nourish the Realm** 🍽️✨

In the grand halls of feasting, where tables overflow with abundance, a silent crisis unfolds—provisions are prepared but never claimed, vanishing into oblivion while many go without.

But now, a new order rises. **Pack The Feed** is the bridge between surplus and need, ensuring that every meal crafted by the realm's finest kitchens finds a worthy home. No feast shall be forgotten. No provision shall go to waste.

**Pack The Feed** is a platform that connects surplus food from dining halls with people who need it, reducing food waste while ensuring meals reach those who can use them.

## Inspirations

Our journey began upon discovering the significant food waste generated by dining facilities. This waste occurs despite the presence of individuals facing food insecurity. Recognizing this disparity, we were inspired to create a solution that bridges the gap between surplus and need.

## What It Does

**Pack The Feed** facilitates the collection of surplus food from dining halls. To ensure the safe distribution of these meals, we employ insulated food carriers, commonly known as "hot boxes" and "cold boxes." These carriers maintain the appropriate temperatures of the food during transport and storage, ensuring that hot meals remain hot and cold items stay fresh. By strategically placing these insulated carriers in accessible locations, we ensure that surplus meals are preserved and distributed safely to those in need.

## How We Built It

Our platform is built upon a foundation of collaboration with dining facilities. We have established a system where surplus food is identified, collected, and stored in insulated carriers. These carriers are then placed in designated areas for distribution. The use of insulated food carriers is crucial, as they maintain the necessary temperatures to keep food safe and palatable during storage and distribution.

## What's Next for Pack The Feed

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance our platform by integrating advanced technologies to further reduce food waste. By leveraging data analytics, we can better predict surplus patterns and optimize collection schedules. Additionally, we plan to expand our network of distribution points, ensuring that more individuals have access to these meals. Our ultimate goal is to create a sustainable model that can be replicated across various institutions, effectively addressing food waste and insecurity on a larger scale.
